TODO:
flesh out asset manager
    -scene manager will work in tandem with asset manager to load assets and show level.
    -load and store assets in memory.
    -unique identifier for each asset.
    -part of loading system.

add scene manager + scenes (class)
Scenes should be XML defined

add button input support in UI, also text boxes

IMPORTANT: Each game object instanced, should have a String ID, so in code any other object can access it, as a game object.

basic animation state machine

audio and audio emitter classes
    - Current implementation just uses:         //ResManager.sound("res/sound.wav").play();

Rendering Related:
    add lighting system
       -r.renderLightSource(Brightness, Color, falloff) -> radial light source, types include: box, circle, etc.
       -Global lighting value
       -render an opaque Image on top of the screen, resolution can be low or high (light-map resolution)
            - LAST RENDER CALL SENT BEFORE FRAME SHOW.
            - useScreenCoordinates = true;
            - r.drawImage(light-map, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT)
       -light emitting sources will add to the final value of light.
       -no shadows yet... (no blockage of light with objects)

GOAL: make this an AI native game engine. Visual Chat + scene editor that uses the java backend to work.
