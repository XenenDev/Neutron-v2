TODO:
flesh out asset manager
    -scene manager will work in tandem with asset manager to load assets and show level.
    -load and store assets in memory.
    -unique identifier for each asset.
    -part of loading system.

add scene manager + scenes (class)

add button input support in UI, also text boxes

IMPORTANT: Each game object instanced, should have a String ID, so in code any other object can access it, as a game object.

sprite sheet support, basic animation

audio and audio emitter classes
    - Current implementation just uses:         //ResManager.sound("res/sound.wav").play();

Rendering Related:

    add lighting system
       -r.renderLightSource(Brightness, Color, falloff) -> radial light source, types include: box, circle, etc.
       -Global lighting value
       -render an opaque Image on top of the screen, resolution can be low or high (light-map resolution)
            - LAST RENDER CALL SENT BEFORE FRAME SHOW.
            - useScreenCoordinates = true;
            - r.drawImage(light-map, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT)
       -light emitting sources will add to the final value of light.
       -no shadows yet... (no blockage of light with objects)


FIXME:
input system, input class "queues" inputs, then game core, "collects" them and runs them all during same time. REDO INPUT CLASS
 -fix unresponsive scale change ( scroll wheel ) unclear what causes this.  but the Player class seems to be getting notified.

Concurrent modification exception
 -reproduced by opening a large image while the game is loading. to recreate, load large image in constructor of walls class
